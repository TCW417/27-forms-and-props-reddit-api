===

This lab uses React to build a front-end for the reddit.com api.  A search box and results limit slider are provided.  Results are shown on the left. When you click on a result the underlying URL and selftext are displayed on the right. If you don't supply a search term, the search text entry box is outlined in red.

There is a random bug in this app that causes it to crash occassionally on an undefined results array.  I'm reporting it but just now I can't duplicate it.  One of those things...
